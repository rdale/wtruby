	* The Smoke library generated code now builds on Windows

2005-10-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The QByteArray class is included in the Smoke lib
	* Fixed bug where the definition of a Null struct on one line
	  in QString confused the parser

2005-02-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a '--qt4' option to parse Qt 4 headers

2005-02-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The KWin class was bracketed with '#ifdef Q_OS_UNIX.. #endif', and was being skipped
	  by kalyptus. Fixes a problem reported by Ian Monroe.

2004-10-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed problem where a call to super in java QWidet.polish() caused a loop
 * DCOPArg and DCOPReply are ignored for java bindings generation

2004-09-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed Smoke library generation for KDE 3.1

2004-09-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Removed forward declarations for classes embedded in method return types.
   For instance:
         virtual class View *createView ( QWidget *parent, const char *name = 0 ) = 0;
         virtual QPtrList<class View> views () const = 0;
 * Added kate as a KDE include header subdirectory


2004-09-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added kontact to the expected KDE header subdirectory names
 * Fixed a bug in the code generation for this method:

     virtual QValueList<Kontact::Plugin*> pluginList() const = 0;

   It was being incorrectly treated as a pointer type, because it contained as asterisk.

2004-08-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * A namespace such as KIO:: can be spread over several header files, the source
   names are now kept in a property list so that all the includes can be generated.

2004-07-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * QMap and QPair template types such as 'QMap<QCString, DCOPRef>' with an 
   embedded comma, were not being correctly normalised. A space was left in 
   the smoke type.

2004-07-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * When the Smoke code for accessing an enum was generated, it was assuming
   that the enum was in the same source file as the class. This doesn't work
   for namespaces like KIO:: where enums can be spread over several source
   files.
 * The solution is to add a source file property to each enum, and when the
   accessor code for the enum is generated a suitable include can be added.
 * Fixes problem reported by Luca Perossa

2004-07-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* After discussion with Germain Garand, QChars have been returned to 
	  the Smoke runtime as first class members.

2004-07-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The QChar class is now treated as a primitive type just like QString.

2004-06-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added DCOPRef to the Smoke runtime. But the various template methods for send(), call() and callExt() 
	  need to be reimplemented in the scripting language.

2004-06-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Java methods now generated for qCompress and qUncompress methods - Michal Ceresna
	  reported that the methods missing from the QtJava api.
	  
2004-06-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Reinstated the KMultiTabBarTab and KMultiTabBarButton classes in the Smoke runtime
	* It makes more sense to fix the parser to handle arg types starting with
	'class '. They are now stripped off and ignored.

2004-06-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed KMultiTabBarTab and KMultiTabBarButton from the Smoke runtime
	* Added an instance variable '_smokeObject' to generated C# Kimono classes

2004-06-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* New flags were added for Smoke methods - mf_internal and mf_copyctor.
	  This allows copy constructors which are only used internally by the ruby
	  or perl runtime, to be excluded from the standard api.

2004-06-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added patch from Michal Ceresna to fix code generation for QImage.bits() and
	  QImage.colorTable()
	* Fixed bug reported by Maik Schulz caused by unwanted KListViewItem copy constructor.
	  An 'enhancement' was added for KDE 3.2 - for any class which didn't have a copy 
	  constructor, but which could still be copied, a copy constructor was generated.
	  Unfortunately this had unforseen consequences, such as messing up KListView logic,
	  hence they're no longer generated.

2004-05-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The methods QPainter::pos() and QFontInfo::font() are skipped for
	  Qt2 embedded as they don't link to the ARM version of Qt/E
	* Thanks to Fabien Renaud for testing QtJava/E on an ARM box

2004-05-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added the correct macro expansion for Q_OBJECT with Qt/E 2.3.x
	* kalyptus can now generate the SMOKE library for Qt Embedded

2004-05-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* More tweaks to the QtJava Embedded code generation.
	  The code now compiles without error, links and runs..
	* However, the Qt framebuffer emulator plasters the KDE desktop in
	  lurid green and doesn't seem to have a way of accepting mouse
	  input. How do you get mouse events into a named pipe that it reads?

2004-05-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added code generation for Qt/Embedded 2.3.4 with a '--qte' option to 
	  be used in conjunction with the '-fjni' option.
	* Example usage - this command will parse the Qt embedded headers in 
	  directory 'test', and generate the .java and .cpp files in the same dir:
	    $ kalyptus -fjni -dtest --globspace --qte test/*.h

2004-05-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The java '-fjni' option now generates correct java code with Qt/E 2.3.4
	* KMainWindow.toolBar() and KMainWindow.menuBar() rename ktoolBar() and
	  kmenuBar(). This is because java doesn't have covariant return types
	  and the methods with the same names in QMainWindow return a QToolBar
	  and QMenuBar, rather than their KDE equivalent subclasses.

2004-05-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Namespaces were being omitted from the SMOKE runtime, and so methods
	  such as the ones in KStdAction were missing. They are now included and
	  appear to be ordinary classes containing static methods.
	    For example, in ruby:
		quit = KDE::StdAction.quit( self, SLOT("quit()"), actionCollection() )

2004-04-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Now only 55 Qt C# warnings, too much use of the 'new' inheritance directive
	  though.

2004-04-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Reduced the number of compiler warnings for C# Dispose() methods. Now down to
	  'only' 130 warnings for the Qt classes

2004-04-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a class includes equality operator overloading, an implementation of 
	  GetHashCode() is generated (along with Equals() too) to avoid compiler warnings.
	* If a method was originally inherited via C++ MI, but is now copied from the superclass
	  to the current class in C# instead, then it isn't labelled with a 'new' modifier

2004-04-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Kimono C# code generation improvements
	    - Added the 'out' modifier for args which are references to mutable primitive types
	    - Improved doc comment to C# xml comment translation, with <remarks> tags bracketing 
	      the body of the comment
	    - Enum types are only given a 'E_' prefix if they clash with a C# method name after
	      the first character has been uppercased

2004-03-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed quite a few compiler warnings from the C# code generated by -fkimono
	  - A lot of warnings about virtual methods not needing the 'new' keyword fixed
	  - If you define operator==, but not operator!= you get a warning. 
	    A smarter compiler might be able to work one out from the other?
	    But added a corresponding 'operator!=' always.
	  - If you define operator== or operator!=, you get a warning for not defining 
	    GetHashCode(). There must be some sort of logic in that, but not fixed yet.
	 
2004-03-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed obsolete C and Objective-C code generation options

2004-03-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* 'KDE Integrates Mono'; added -fkimono option to generate C# bindings
	* It doens't use the Qt C bindings, like Qt# but the Smoke lib instead
	* To generate the code and review the api, edit kdebindings/smoke/kde/generate.pl.in
	  and change '-fsmoke' to '-fkimono'. Then configure kdebindings with the
	  '--with-smoke=kde' option. The sources will be generated in smoke/kde.
	* It uses custom real proxies as AOP style interceptors, one per instance
	  and a static interceptor per class.
	  - Every method call in the api is forwarded to SmokeInvocation.Invoke()
	    via the proxies, and is effectively a pointcut.
	  - In Invoke() the method call will be looked up dynamically from the Smoke runtime
	  - The arguments are marsalled from C# to C++ on the Smoke::Stack, and the method
	    invoked.
	* The KDE doc comments are converted to C# xml style tags (eg KApplication.cs)
	* Problems
	  - A small fix was need for RealProxies with Mono 0.30. DotGnu doesn't have
	    RealProxies/remoting yet.
	  - It should be possible to use ContextBoundObjects and custom ContextAttributes
	    as described here, but they aren't implemented in Mono yet.
		http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/03/ContextsinNET/
	  - In interfaces the 'ref' keyword can't be used
	  - Doesn't use event handlers as delegates like Qt#, they are just overriden
	    like normal virtual methods
	  - Many compiler warnings about 'new virtual' not being needed. Some work needed
	    to only add new to overriden ones.

2004-02-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Aligned the forthcoming KDE 3.3 dynamic proxy/SMOKE library based java 
	  code generation with the current 3.2 JNI based ones (-fjava vs. -fjni).

2004-01-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When two methods differed only in 'constness', it wasn't possible to
	  resolve which to call from ruby. For example:
		KProgress* progressBar();
		const KProgress* progressBar() const;
	  So only the const variant is generated in the Smoke runtime.

2004-01-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a java method needed to be renamed, because in the type signature 
	  only the return type differed in C++, when that isn't allowed in java,
	  the JNI function name was not using the new name.
	* Fixed error in JNI function names when the C++ method had an underscore.


2003-12-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed a problem with parsing one line namespace declarations
	* Added support for the QT_WORKSPACE_WINDOWMODE macro, to solve build problem
	* Added some more primitive type definitions such as KIO::filesize_t

2003-12-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a '-fjni' option to generate code for the current KDE 3.2 JNI based java
	  bindings The '-fjava' option generates code for the forthcoming Dynamic
	  Proxy/Smoke library based java bindings in KDE 3.3.
	* The Qt and KDE bindings just checked in were generated by changing the kalyptus 
	  option '-fsmoke' to '-fjni' in kdebindings/smoke/kde/generate.pl.in. Then
	  configure kdebindings with '--enable-smoke=kde' option to generate the .cpp
	  and .java sources. The .h files are generated by using javah on the compiled
	  java .class files.

2003-11-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed parsing of casts inside enums in kfileitem.h:
	      enum { Unknown = (mode_t) - 1 };
	  Hmm, not sure what that's up to anyway..
	* Added a special Source property to method nodes in QGlobalSpace.
	  In java, this allows Qt friend methods to be grouped under the
	  Qt.java class, and KDE ones under KDE.java according to which 
	  source file they originated from.

2003-11-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed parsing default argument values cast to a numeric literal, eg:
	    mode_t mode = (mode_t)-1
	* Excluded a couple of structs from kparts/browserextension

2003-11-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* KDE MI has some diamond shaped cycles, such as for the children of
	  KXMLGUIClient. When the code for casts to all the parents of a class
	  was generated in the Smoke runtime, this meant there were some 
	  duplicate entries in the switch statement. Duplicates now removed.


2003-10-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Avoid generating wrappers for private classes with 'Private',
	  'Impl' or 'Internal' in the name. Other unneeded classes also
	  dropped. 

2003-10-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added SmokeKDE namespace class code generation
	  - Fixed bug in kalyptus where it couldn't detect the end of a namespace
	  - resolveType() in kalyptusDataDict.pm now looks in parent namespace for symbols
	  - Namespace enclosed class code generation added to kalyptusCxxToSmoke.pm 

2003-09-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added various parser and code generation fixes so that a libsmokekde.so
	  can be generated from the kdelibs headers.

2003-08-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Applied Germain Garand's patch to no longer rename operator methods 
	  in the QGlobalSpace pseudo class

2003-08-21  Alexander Kellett  <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Added .kidl generation option (dcopidl replacement)
	* Handled of several new constructs in the parsing:
	*    k_dcop: / k_dcop_signals: / K_DCOP:
	* Use STDERR not STDOUT thus removing need for temporary file

2003-08-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added missing getClassLoader() call to Proxy constructor

2003-08-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Rewritten java code generation for a Dynamic Proxy based SMOKE adaptor version of QtJava.
	* Based on David Faure's SMOKE generation code in the '-fsmoke' option.

2003-08-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed old SWIG style ruby generation option

2003-08-09  Alexander Kellett  <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Parse static friend operator methods and place into a pseudo class (for smoke)

2002-06-03  David Faure  <faure@kde.org>

	* The Smoke generation is in good shape. Removed old PerlPig and PerlQK
	modules.

2002-04-23  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added patch from David Faure to correctly handle nested struct
         or class names in perl .pig generation

2002-03-15  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Added C# P/Invoke bindings generation option from Adam Treat
2002-02-10  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Improved C destructor code generation
	* QCanvasItemList mapped onto java.util.ArrayList
	* 'bool *' type converted to java 'boolean[]' type.
2002-02-03  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
 	
	* More fixes to .pig generation from Germain. Perl porting now 
         motoring 24*7...
2002-02-02  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Various improvements to Perl .pig generation from Germain Garand
2002-01-31  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Fixed bug in code generation for NULL default arguments
	* Added some new KDE 3 types
2002-01-26  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Perl .pig generation improved
2002-01-25  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Added '-fperl' option to autogenerate .pig (Perl Interface 
         Generator) files, suitable for generating Ashley Winters' PerlQt/KDEQt 
         bindings
2002-01-23  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Made dispose() public, added isDisposed() after SWT.
2002-01-23  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Added generation of dispose() methods, to allow large resources,
         such as pixmaps, to be freed before finalize() is called.
2002-01-20  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Ruby bindings generation - initial checkin.
2002-01-04  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	* Fixed bug in parsing decimal point in default argument values
2001-12-29  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk
	* JNI event handling methods are now generated.
	* Some additions for KDevelop types. 
	* Removed assumption that a class ending in '..Interface' should always 
         be a java interface.
2001-12-17  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk
	* Improved code generation for String f'ns with default arguments.
	* An implementation is no longer generated for classes which are
         just interfaces.
2001-12-03  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk
	* Added new KDE 3 data types
	* Improved code generation for classes defined within namespaces
